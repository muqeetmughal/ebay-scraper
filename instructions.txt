Hi, i just completed the Project.
There is a file inside folder named as "main.py"

First of all Make Sure that Python 3.8 or 3.9 is installed on your System

Make sure these Modules are installed on your System:
BeautifulSoup
Selenium

, if not installed just Open CMD Terminal
and type these Commands:

"pip install bs4, selenium"

then open terminal in the Current Working Directory and type:

"python main.py"


to run the scaraper

After Scrapper Run Successfully, it will create a result_{time of creation}.csv file

if still you face any problem during this process, let me know i will help you to run the file.

Thanks
